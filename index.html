<p>In 2019, I actually got to travel to several places in Europe including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Germany. <br> My favorite place to visit was Paris. The food was amazing and the architecture was so pretty! </p>

<p>This first image is of the Brandenburg Gate located in Berlin. During my visit to Europe, I actually <br> got to visit this site and it's beautiful! <br> During sunset the view is stunning and it was a really cool way to end off my trip in Germany.<br>There are tons of little stores for tourists to buy souvenirs like shirts, stickers, or even posters like shown in this image above.</p>

<p> Traveling not only allows you to emmerse yourself in other cultures, new food, and new experiences but, it also <br> allows you to learn so much more about yourself. Traveling is something you will never regret and it will bring <br>you so many <b>unique memories!</b></p>

<h1>Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness</h1>
<h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>

<p>By: Beth Skwarecki</p>

<img src="fitness.jpg" width="650" height="450">

<p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>

<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>

<h3>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h3>

<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Running a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.</li>
</ul>
