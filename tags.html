<p>In 2019, I actually got to travel to several places in Europe including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Germany. <br> My favorite place to visit was Paris. The food was amazing and the architecture was so pretty! </p>
<h3>Classical music always reminds me of Paris.</h3>

I downloaded this music from youtube audio library

<p>This first image is of the Brandenburg Gate located in Berlin. During my visit to Europe, I actually 
    <br> got to visit this site and it's beautiful! 
    <br> During <span style="color:orange">sunset</span> the view is stunning and it was a really cool way to end off my trip in Germany.
    <br>There are tons of little stores for tourists to buy souvenirs like shirts, stickers, or even posters like shown in this image above.</p>

<p> Traveling not only allows you to emmerse yourself in other cultures, new food, and new experiences but, it also <br> allows you to learn so much more about yourself. Traveling is something you will never regret and it will bring <br>you so many <b>unique memories!</b></p>
