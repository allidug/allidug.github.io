<h1>My Experience with CSS & HTML</h1>

<h3 class="smile"> Before starting this class, I had zero experience with coding. Honestly, I was a little nervous because I didn't really know what to expect. <br> As I started to learn the basics and actually begin to build mock websites, I can definitely say I have found a new passion!<br> I never really struggled with anything major other than the normal adjustments to typing in all lower case, remembering to hit the save button often, and <br> learning all of the new code language. I can say that this class has been one of my favorites during my time at Boise State!</h3>

<h4 class="simple">Here are 2 examples of a mock website I created about my hometown and the coding behind another assignment. <br> I really wanted to experiment with CSS so I made my website very colorful and have lots of borders.</h4>

<h2 class="pants">Tips & Tricks</h2>
<h3 class="grape">
    <li>Use all resources around you. The Website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"">W3schools</a> is a great tool for if you get stuck. They show step-by-step processes and examples of coding with pictures!</li>
    <li>Be creative with your work! It's easy to get caught up on the logistics but, don't forget to personalize your coding to your own style!</li>
    <li>Focus on the fundamentals. Once you learn the basics of coding, it becomes a lot easier to add new coding tricks into your portfolio and expand your knowledge.</li>

    <h3>Here is a list of things I like to do:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
    <li>Trying new restaurants</li>
    <li><b>Traveling!</b></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019, I actually got to travel to several places in Europe including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Germany. <br> My favorite place to visit was Paris. The food was amazing and the architecture was so pretty! </p>
<h3>Classical music always reminds me of Paris.</h3>

I downloaded this music from youtube audio library

<h3>Here are the top 3 places you must visit when traveling to Europe!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Honfleur, France</li>
    <li><b>Berlin, Germany</b></li>
    <li>Liège, Belgium</li>
</ol>

<p>This first image is of the Brandenburg Gate located in Berlin. During my visit to Europe, I actually 
    <br> got to visit this site and it's beautiful! 
    <br> During <span style="color:orange">sunset</span> the view is stunning and it was a really cool way to end off my trip in Germany.
    <br>There are tons of little stores for tourists to buy souvenirs like shirts, stickers, or even posters like shown in this image above.</p>

<h3><strong>If you ever have a chance to travel outside of the United States, I highly recommend visiting Europe.</strong></h3>

<p> Traveling not only allows you to emmerse yourself in other cultures, new food, and new experiences but, it also <br> allows you to learn so much more about yourself. Traveling is something you will never regret and it will bring <br>you so many <b>unique memories!</b></p>
